## - Cows Don't Deserve To Live (They Fart Too Much) -

Don't like cows? Check!  
Like Alters? Check!  
Like needing to sacrifice an innocent animal just for your mortal soul to maintain itself in this endless cave of nothingness? Check?

Welcome to the Caves of Cows, where cows appear out of seeming nowhere. To maintain your life as long as you can, you must find cows, pick them up, and take them to an alter.  
You're also trying to escape the caves, so try to go up, not down! (You lose score if you go down)
